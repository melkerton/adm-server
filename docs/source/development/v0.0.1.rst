v0.0.1
======

----------------------
Minimal Viable Product
----------------------

The objective of v0.0.1 is to provide a means to test Keycloak endpoints. As such the only Writers that will be implemented is the DefaultResponseWriter and the PipeResponseWriter. 


**Functional Requirements**

    - match requests on

        - path + query, regex or exact

    - support any common case response

**Target Test Cases**

Case 1) Simple response

Request

.. code-block::

    GET /alpha HTTP/1.1
    host: localhost
    
    .


Response


.. code-block::

    HTTP/1.1 200 Ok

    http://localhost/alpha HTTP/1.1

Development notes
-----------------

Need to complete Keycloak testing for Barter Ledger.

- the request is immutable and defined by the requesting client
- matching on every thing is not required

    - method yes
    - version no
    - headers no
    - path yes
    - query partially
    - body no

for v0.0.1 only support matching on method and path + query as a whole

required features

- ability to return jwt token with valid expiration date

potential features

- regex on path matching
